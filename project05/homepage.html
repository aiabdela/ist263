                <h2 class="title">what is swimming?</h2>
                <p class="firstp">
                    According to worldwide resources, there are 8,000 sports played and swimming is one of them. It turned out to be the most known sport in the world involved in every popular game such as the Olympics.<br> It is considered as an individual sport, and its events take place in pools or open water.
                    when it comes to pool swimming, it should be divided into 8 corridors. <br>so, the competitors have their own space to go further and back in a linear way. By that separation, the results are judged by who touches the wall first with the shortest time on overall swimmers win the race. 
                    the pool swimming consists of five major strokes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>backstroke</li>
                        <li>breaststroke</li>
                        <li>butterfly</li>
                        <li>freestyle</li>
                        <li>combination of the above</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>

        <div class="stroke">
            <h2 class="T2">with various distances: </h2>
            <p class="secondp">
                In competition, there are freestyle races at distances of 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1,500 meters; backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly races at 100 meters and 200 meters; individual medley races at 200 meters and 400 meters; the freestyle relays, 4 × 100 meters, and 4 × 200 meters; and the medley relay, 4 × 100 meters.
                <br>Turning to the open water swimming, it is a competition where all the swimmers have to swim long distances in a lake or sea.<br> Therefore, It requires more carrying and concentration as it contains no corridor and all the swimmers start at the same time (top 100 swimmers). Such swimming events are characterized by extreme water conditions like water temperature, tides, currents, and waves. Influencing tactics impact on performance.
                It ranges from quite modest to extremely long distances:
                <ol>
                    <li>1-3 kilometers (0.6-1.9 miles)</li>
                    <li>5 kilometers (3.1 miles)</li>
                    <li>10 kilometers (6.2 miles)</li>
                    <li>25 kilometers (15.5 miles) and beyond.</li>
                </ol>
                <div class="free">Freestyle is the most widely used stroke in open water swimming due to its efficiency and speed; however, different strokes may be employed depending on the event. </div>
